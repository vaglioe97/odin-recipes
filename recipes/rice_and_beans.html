    <h1>Rice and Beans Recipe (Caribean)</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Rice and Beans</em></strong> combines red beans with rice cooked in coconut milk,<br> 
        and spiced with a bit of habanero pepper.The dish is said in English,<br> 
        rather than Spanish, because of the Jamaican influence both on the dish<br> 
        itself and the language in the Caribbean.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>For the Beans</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb red beans</li>
        <li>1/2 red pepper, cut into 3 pieces</li>
        <li>handful cilantro, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, whole</li>
        <li>1/2 white or yellow onion, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt (we prefer sea salt)</li>
        <li>Salsa Lizano (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the Rice and Beans</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups black beans or kidney beans, cooked</li>
        <li>1½ cups coconut milk</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 small roll of fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 stick margarine (substitute butter)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Sazón Completo</li>
        <li>¼ cup Salsa Lizano</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, leaves on, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>½ sweet red pepper, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cups long-grain white rice, uncooked</li>
        <li>3 whole habanero peppers</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the Beans</h4>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the beans and place them in the crock pot.</li>
        <li>Rinse and chop your veggies, then add them on top of the beans. </li>
        <li>Add salt and enough water to cover the beans, plus about another 2 inches.<br>
            Since the beans do absorb quite a bit of water when cooking, you want to have<br>
            some extra so the beans do not scald and stick to the bottom of your pot.  </li>
        <li>Cook the beans in the slow cooker on low for 8-10 hours, or cook on high for 4-5 hours.<br>
            The cooking time varies depending on your pot and electrical current.</li>
        <li>I add the salt at the beginning of the recipe, but many people prefer to add it in the last<br>
            30 minutes of cooking because they say the salt makes the beans harden. I don not think it<br>
            does, but to each his own.</li>
        <li>When you are ready to serve, just remove the large vegetable chunks and serve separately, or<br>
            keep them in!</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>For the Rice and Beans</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop garlic, celery, onion, and red pepper.</li>
        <li>Place beans in a large stockpot and add coconut milk and water. </li>
        <li>Place the roll of thyme, not chopped, in the pot with the beans.<br>
            Then add margarine, curry powder, black pepper, Sazón Completo, Salsa Lizano, and stir. </li>
        <li>Add garlic, bell pepper, chopped onion, and celery to the pot and stir again.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil on medium-high heat and allow to boil 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add rice to the pot and stir. You know you have the right amount of liquid when a wooden<br>
            or plastic stirring spoon stands straight up in the middle of the pot with the rice and<br>
            does not fall over.</li>
        <li>Place three whole habanero peppers into the pot and cover. Allow the mixture to simmer for<br>
            20 minutes on medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Once rice is cooked, serve!</li>
    </ol>
